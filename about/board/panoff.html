    Dr. Robert M. Panoff is founder and Executive Director of The Shodor
    Education Foundation, Inc., and has been a consultant at several national
    laboratories. He is also a frequent presenter at NSF- sponsored workshops
    on visualization, supercomputing, and networking, and continues to serve as
    consultant for the education program at the National Center for
    Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at
    Urbana-Champaign. He has served on the advisory panel for Applications of
    Advanced Technology program at NSF. Dr. Panoff received his M.A. and Ph.D.
    in theoretical physics from Washington University in St. Louis, undertaking
    both pre- and postdoctoral work at the Courant Institute of Mathematical
    Sciences at New York University.

    As principal investigator on several NSF grants that seek to explore the
    interaction of high performance computing technologies and education, he
    worked to develop a series of interactive simulations which combine
    supercomputing resources and desktop computers. Besides developing and
    teaching a new course in Information Technologies, Dr. Panoff continues an
    active research program in computational condensed matter physics while
    defining and implementing educational initiatives at the Shodor Foundation.

    At Kansas State University and Clemson University from 1986-1990, he
    developed a fully interdisciplinary computational science and engineering
    course. He served as director of the Carolinas Institute in Computational
    Science, an NSF-funded initiative in Undergraduate Faculty Enhancement,
    1991-1993. His work has won several major science and education awards,
    including the 1990 Cray Gigaflop Performance Award in Supercomputing, the
    1994 and 1995 Undergraduate Computational Science Education Awards from the
    U.S. Department of Energy, and a 1995 Achievement Award from the Chicago
    Chapter of the Society for Technical Communication. In 1993-1994, his
    interactive simulations were used as the basis of an international science
    collaboration demonstrating network technologies involving four of the
    schools from the Department of Defense Dependent Schools, for which he
    received a letter of commendation from the Department of Defense. In
    recognition of Dr. Panoff's efforts in undergraduate faculty enhancement
    and curriculum development, the Shodor Foundation was named in 1996 as a
    Foundation Partner of the National Science Foundation for the revitalization
    of undergraduate education.
