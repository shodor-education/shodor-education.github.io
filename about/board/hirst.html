    Since Dr. Hirst received her Ph.D. in mathematics from the Pennsylvania
    State University in 1989, she has been active in the field of computational
    science. Over the last ten years, she has given more than 75 presentations
    and taught more than 50 workshops centered around incorporating modeling and
    computation into mathematics and science courses at all levels. She was
    co-Principle Investigator on both the NSF Undergraduate Faculty Enhancement
    grant that funded the <em>Shodor Computational Science Institutes</em> from
    1998 to 2002 and on the NSF Course, Curriculum and Laboratory Improvement
    grant that currently funds the National Computational Science Institute.
