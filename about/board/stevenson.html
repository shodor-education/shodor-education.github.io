    D. E. Stevenson, known as `Steve' to one and all, is an associate professor
    of computer science at Clemson University in Clemson, SC. He has been at
    Clemson since 1980. The trail to Clemson is long and winding.

    He received a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics from Eastern Michigan
    University in June, 1965. At that time, he received a commission in the US
    Army as an Infantry officer. In the next four plus years he served overseas
    twice: Korea in 1966 and as a battalion advisor in the Hue area of South
    Vietnam in 1968.

    Steve joined Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1969. He worked in several
    computer support areas until 1975 when he found a home in performance and
    modeling of computer systems. In this time frame he received a Masters of
    Science degree at Rutgers in computer science. After spending a sabbatical
    assignment in theoretical biophysics, he decided to move on.

    Soon-to-be-Doctor Stevenson moved his family (wife, son, and daughter) to
    Clemson. There he took a lecture-ship in computer science and a PhD in
    mathematical sciences at Clemson under Dan Warner (also a board member of
    Shodor). Upon graduation, the Stevensons decided to stay in Clemson. Steve's
    main interest is computational science and engineering. His research focus
    is constructive foundations of mathematics in general and numerical
    computing in particular.
