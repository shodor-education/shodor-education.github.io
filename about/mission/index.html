        <strong> Our mission: to improve math and science education through the
        effective use of modeling and simulation technologies â€” "computational
        science."</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Shodor, a national resource for computational
        science education is located in Durham, N.C., and <strong>serves
        students and educators nationwide.</strong> Our online education tools
        such as
        <a href="{{ '/interactivate/' | relative_url }}">Interactivate</a> and
        <a href="{{ '/refdesk/' | relative_url }}">Computational Science
          Education Reference Desk (CSERD)</a>
        , a Pathway Portal of the National Science Digital Library (NSDL), help
        transform learning through computational thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to developing and deploying <strong>interactive models,
        simulations, and educational tools, </strong> Shodor serves students and
        educators directly through workshops and other hands-on experiences.
        Shodor offers innovative workshops <strong> helping faculty and teachers
        incorporate computational science into their own curricula</strong> or
        programs. This work is done primarily though the
        <a href="http://www.computationalscience.org/">National Computational
          Science Institute (NCSI)</a>
        in partnership with XSEDE, Blue Waters, the National Center for
        Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), and other NSF-funded initiatives.

        For students from <strong>middle school through undergraduate</strong>
        levels of education, Shodor offers <strong>workshops, apprenticeships,
        internships and off-site programs</strong> that explore new approaches
        to math and science education through computational science.
      </p>
      <p>
        Time and time again, Shodor has been recognized as a <strong>national
        leader and a premier resource in the effective use of computers to
        improve both math and science education. </strong>
