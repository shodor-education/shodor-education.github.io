        Since its incorporation in 1994, Shodor has come a long way, pursuing
        the mission of <strong>improving math and science education through
        computational science.</strong> At the core of Shodor's dramatic growth
        and effectiveness is its authentic use of computers in transforming
        science and mathematics education through the internet and network
        technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the beginning, when many other education-focused organizations were
        utilizing CD's to capture and share their resources, Shodor recognized
        the <strong>power of the internet and networking,</strong> and developed
        those components of its activities through tools like
        <a href="{{ '/interactivate/' | relative_url }}">Interactivate</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the beginning, with just three computational science tools to its
        name, Shodor was able to easily demonstrate the engaging world of
        computational science. Through real-time manipulation of data
        representations on a computer screen and showing how the end results
        take shape "right before your eyes," the message was clear. Educators
        marveled at the instructional opportunities and students began to <strong>
        learn math and science concepts in a much more realistic and meaningful
        way. </strong>

        As internet and networking technologies advanced and as connectivity
        became faster and more powerful, Shodor responded with more effective
        tools and saw continued growth in its audience of educators and students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, Shodor's bank of computational science education tools has grown
        to a substantial level. They are widely utilized on <strong>national and
        international</strong> levels. Today, the Shodor websites garner
        <strong>3-million to 3.5-million page views per month.</strong> Tools
        such as Interactivate and the Computational Science Education Reference
        Desk (CSERD) are not only website award-winners, but they are widely
        <strong> popular among students and educators alike</strong> and help
        to improve math and science education. Usage and linkage has been so
        extensive that a “Google” search for nearly any term in math or science
        (try, for instance: acid base, stoichiometry, pie chart, histogram, bar
        graph, stopwatch, arithmetic quiz, among others) will return <strong>
        Shodor resources at or near the top of the list.</strong>

        Shodor has grown to a staff of 16 scientists and educators, and proudly
        <strong>involves more than 30 interns and a dozen apprentices</strong>
        in many aspects of our internet and network design, creation and
        maintenance -- a unique and meaningful “real world” hands-on learning
        project for all of the students. <strong>Dozens of college faculty who
        are graduates of the
        <a href="http://www.computationalscience.org/">National Computational
          Science Institute (NCSI)</a>
        workshops are active collaborators, and more than 1,000 NCSI alumni
        participate in the review process of the
        <a href="{{ '/refdesk/' | relative_url }}">Computational Science
          Education Reference Desk (CSERD)</a>.</strong>
